### 1. **Basic Output Printing**
```java

public class try1 {
    public try1() {
    }

    public static void main(String[] name) {
        int tot = 240;
        int avg = tot / 3;
        String name1 = "Agnihotra Nath";
        System.out.println("Name of Student:" + name1);
        System.out.println("Marks obtained in Subject 1: 90");
        System.out.println("Marks obtained in Subject 2: 80");
        System.out.println("Marks obtained in Subject 3: 70");
        System.out.println("Total Marks obtained:" + tot);
        System.out.println("Average of Marks obtained:" + avg);
    }
}
```
